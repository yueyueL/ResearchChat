## About ChatResearch

ChatResearch is an AI-powered desktop application designed to assist journal students and researchers in their academic pursuits. It's currently in its preview version, offering a glimpse into the future of AI-assisted research.

### Why ChatResearch?

As researchers and students, we often find ourselves asking questions like:

- "What are the recent updates in my research area on arXiv?"
- "What problems were solved at top conferences in my domain like ICML, CVPR, or USENIX Security?"
- "How can I quickly summarize the key findings of this paper?"
- "What are the potential research gaps in my field?"

ChatResearch is designed to answer these questions and more, leveraging the power of AI to provide insights in minutes, not hours.
